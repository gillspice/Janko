#   Other DRILL_HOLE_TYPE values are 'OVAL_SLOT' and 'RECTANGLE_SLOT',
#   but they are being filtered out here as they do not factor in to
#   NC Drill outputs.
#
#   Slot hole types would have their major dimension in DRILL_HOLE_NAME
#   and their minor dimension in DRILL_HOLE_NAME2. CIRCLE_DRILL types
#   will simply have DRILL_HOLE_NAME2 set to the same value as in
#   DRILL_HOLE_NAME. DRILL_HOLE_NONSTANDARD, and multi-drill fields such
#   DRILL_ARRAY_LOCATIONS do not apply to slot holes. DRILL_FIGURE_ROTATION
#   for slot holes will contain the rotation to be applied to the slot
#   hole, with the assumption of 0 degrees being the major dimension
#   of the slot hole along the X axis.
